# Lion Kingdom : Liberation Delta
A 2D platformer where a single primate aims to change the world.

The goal of this 2D Side Scroller is to release the unjust inprisonment of primates in a futuristic distopia where lions have taken over the world. The user takes control of the last free primate with the mighty task to save his brethren in shackles. Using W, A, S, and D to move, the user quickly becomes accustomed to the fight mechanics through intuitive explanations and world building.

At the end of each level, a new weapon is unlocked and its use is necessary in order to beat the progressively more difficult levels. The final level takes place is a castle where the user must fight their way to the final boss and eventually.. to freedom.
